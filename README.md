- 👋 Hi, I’m @gustavotalvares.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, nodeJS, and RESTful APIs and deepening my knowledge in HTML and CSS with bootstrap and SASS.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment, since I need a little more study on git and experience on personal projects but I'm always up to help.
- 📫 You can reach me on my instagram @gus_trentini
